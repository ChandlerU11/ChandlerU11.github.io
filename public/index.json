[{"content":"\r\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e Class Imbalance and Problem Statement Class imbalance is a common problem when building classifiers in the machine learning world, and our awesome previously-scraped croc reviews data is unfortunately not so awesome from a class balance standpoint. Soon, we\u0026rsquo;ll assign binary class labels based on the rating a customer gave with their review where we\u0026rsquo;ll consider ratings of 2 stars (out of 5) or less to be negative sentiment and the remaining reviews as positive sentiment. As you\u0026rsquo;ll see in a moment, the vast majority of reviews belong to the positive sentiment class, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s great!\nHowever, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe Crocs reached the top of the shoe game by mistake. I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to bet the creators behind Crocs are more than willing to confront their flaws and improve upon them. Let\u0026rsquo;s pretend the good people behind Crocs have asked us to build an ML model to effectively classify the rare negative review for their product despite the severe class imbalance. They don\u0026rsquo;t mind a few misclassifications of the positive reviews here and there but would prefer there aren\u0026rsquo;t a ton of these instances.\nQuick Note on Positive / Negative Lingo Traditionally, the positive class in a binary labeled dataset is the minority class of most interest / importance, and that will hold true in this project. Apologies for any confusion, but going forward when I reference the positive class, I will be referencing the set of negative sentiment reviews.\nPositive Class (1) - Negative Sentiment Review :( Negative Class (0) - Positive Sentiment Review :) Below is a look at the class imbalance of our data.\nimport pandas as pd from collections import Counter import seaborn as sns df = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;/content/drive/MyDrive/croc_reviews.csv\u0026#39;) df[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;] = [0 if each \u0026gt; 2 else 1 for each in df[\u0026#39;rating\u0026#39;]] sns.countplot(x = df[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;], hue = df[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;]) print(\u0026#34;Only\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;{:.0%}\u0026#34;.format(label_count[1] / (label_count[1] + label_count[0])), \u0026#34;of our data belongs to the positive class.\u0026#34;) Only 6% of our data belongs to the positive class. Data Clean Up Before we start addressing the class imbalance issue, let\u0026rsquo;s clean up the reviews using the text cleaning function we\u0026rsquo;ve used before.\nimport re import string import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer def clean_text(text): # Remove punctuation text = re.sub(f\u0026#34;[{re.escape(string.punctuation)}]\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, text) # Remove numbers text = re.sub(r\u0026#39;\\d+\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, text) # Convert to lowercase text = text.lower() # Remove stopwords nltk.download(\u0026#39;stopwords\u0026#39;, quiet=True) stop_words = set(stopwords.words(\u0026#39;english\u0026#39;)) tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text) tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words] # Stemming stemmer = PorterStemmer() tokens = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokens] # Join the tokens back into a single string cleaned_text = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join(tokens) return cleaned_text df[\u0026#39;clean_review\u0026#39;] = [clean_text(text_to_clean) for text_to_clean in df[\u0026#39;review\u0026#39;]] df review date rating label clean_review 0 !!!!!!

We will also watch F2 score, a modified version of F1 score that increases the importance of recall in its calculation. Why F2 score? We are concerned with maximizing recall, but a model that predicts the minority class 100% of the time would achieve a perfect recall score. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t help us very much, and F2 score will give us an understanding of how well the model can differentiate between the two classes along with how well the model can identify positive samples. Below are the formulas to calculate the performance metrics.\nRecall - True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative) Precision - True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) F2 Score - (5 * Precision * Recall) / (4 * Precision + Recall) There are a lot of ways to address the imbalanced data problem when training a classifier. In this project we\u0026rsquo;re going to adopt the following strategy:\nImplement multiple methods for resampling the data Train multiple baseline models using each of the resampling methods to see which resampling / model combo performs the best out of the box based on F2 and recall score Use GridsearchCV to tune the best baseline model for recall score whilst continuing to use the best resampling technique Alter the model\u0026rsquo;s decision threshold to maximize recall score Step 1: Implement Multiple Resampling Methods Thank goodness for the Imbalanced-Learn library because it makes data resampling much easier. The term resampling refers to the practice of balancing data by either selecting a subset of the majority class equal in size to the minority class (known as under-sampling) or artificially making the minority class as large as the majority (known as over-sampling). There are many different techniques for doing these processes, but we\u0026rsquo;ll try out the following:\nRandom Over-sampling - Randomly selects samples from the minority class and replaces them in the dataset. Random Under-sampling - Randomly selects and removes samples from the majority class. SMOTE Over-sampling - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) generates new samples for the minority class by imitating its features. The original paper explaining the technique can be found here. Cluster Under-sampling - Under-samples the majority class by replacing a cluster of majority samples by the cluster centroid of a KMeans algorithm. Keeps N majority samples by fitting the KMeans algorithm with N clusters to the majority class and keeping the centroids. The original paper explaining the technique can be found here from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, recall_score, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, precision_recall_curve from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler, SMOTE from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler, ClusterCentroids import numpy as np def rand_oversample(X, y): ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42) X_res, y_res = ros.fit_resample(X, y) return {\u0026#39;X_train\u0026#39;: X_res, \u0026#39;y_train\u0026#39;:y_res} def rand_undersample(X, y): rus = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42) X_res, y_res = rus.fit_resample(X, y) return {\u0026#39;X_train\u0026#39;: X_res, \u0026#39;y_train\u0026#39;:y_res} def smote_oversample(X,y): sm = SMOTE(random_state=42) X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y) return {\u0026#39;X_train\u0026#39;: X_res, \u0026#39;y_train\u0026#39;:y_res} def cluster_undersample(X, y): cc = ClusterCentroids( estimator=MiniBatchKMeans(n_init=1, random_state=0), random_state=42) X_res, y_res = cc.fit_resample(X, y) return {\u0026#39;X_train\u0026#39;: X_res, \u0026#39;y_train\u0026#39;:y_res} Holdout test set Let\u0026rsquo;s split our data into a train and test set. We will not alter the balance of the test set because we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do that in the real world. However, our train set will undergo resampling as we find the best baseline model and resampling combo.\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split def show_imb(label): imb = Counter(label) return str(imb[0]) + \u0026#39; Negative Samples | \u0026#39; + str(imb[1]) + \u0026#39; Positive Samples\u0026#39; # We\u0026#39;ll be using TF-IDF for this project vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer() vect_df = pd.DataFrame(vectorizer.fit_transform(df[\u0026#39;clean_review\u0026#39;]).todense(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()) vect_df[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;].copy() # Train / test split df_train, df_test = train_test_split(vect_df, test_size = .1, random_state = 0) y_train, y_test = df_train[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;].tolist(), df_test[\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;].tolist() X_train, X_test = df_train.drop([\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;], axis = 1), df_test.drop([\u0026#39;label\u0026#39;], axis = 1) print(\u0026#39;Holdout Test Set Class Balance: \u0026#39; + show_imb(y_test)) Holdout Test Set Class Balance: 872 Negative Samples | 52 Positive Samples Step 2: Train Multiple Baseline Classifiers Using Resampling Methods Let\u0026rsquo;s alter our training data using each of the resampling methods and train using each one.

The logistic regression / cluster undersample performs similarly in terms of recall, but maintains a much better F2 score, so we\u0026rsquo;ll move forward with that model! Let\u0026rsquo;s have a better look at its performance out of the box using a confusion matrix.\ndef show_confusion(y_test, pred): cf = confusion_matrix(y_test, pred) group_names = [\u0026#34;True Negatives\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;False Positives\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;False Negatives\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;True Positives\u0026#34;] group_perc = [cf.flatten()[0] / (cf.flatten()[0] + cf.flatten()[1]), cf.flatten()[1] / (cf.flatten()[0] + cf.flatten()[1]) , cf.flatten()[2] / (cf.flatten()[2] + cf.flatten()[3]), cf.flatten()[3] / (cf.flatten()[2] + cf.flatten()[3])] group_perc_str = [\u0026#34;{:.0%}\u0026#34;.format(each) for each in group_perc] group_counts = [\u0026#34;{0:0.0f}\u0026#34;.format(value) for value in cf.flatten()] labels = labels = [f\u0026#34;{v1} {v2}\\n{v3} of class total\u0026#34; for v1, v2, v3 in zip(group_counts, group_names, group_perc_str)] labels = np.asarray(labels).reshape(2,2) group_perc = np.asarray(group_perc).reshape(2,2) print(sns.heatmap(group_perc, annot=labels, fmt = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, cmap=\u0026#39;Greens\u0026#39;)) best_baseline_model = results_df.loc[(results_df[\u0026#39;model_name\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;Logistic Regression\u0026#39;) \u0026amp; (results_df[\u0026#39;sampling_type\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;cluster_undersample\u0026#39;)][\u0026#39;model\u0026#39;][0] show_confusion(y_test, best_baseline_model.predict(X_test)) We\u0026rsquo;re already in a really good spot as we are correctly identifying the positive class over 96% of the time. We have more false positives than I\u0026rsquo;d like, but maybe some hyperparameter tuning can help here.\nStep 3: Finding Best Hyperparams with GridsearchCV For finding the best logistic regression hyperparams, we will use Scikit-Learn\u0026rsquo;s GridSearchCV in combination with an Imblearn Pipeline. GridsearchCV performs an exhaustive search over the provided parameters and performs cross-validation for every parameter combination. Imblearn\u0026rsquo;s Pipeline allows us to perform the same resampling technique we chose in step two with GridsearchCV. The pipeline will resample the training data using cluster undersampling but will not touch the balance of the test data in the fold. We\u0026rsquo;ll set up GridsearchCV to optimize for recall score and have it return the model that performed the best in terms of average recall across all folds.\nfrom imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV model = Pipeline([ # Perform resampling on train split (\u0026#39;sampling\u0026#39;, ClusterCentroids(estimator=MiniBatchKMeans(n_init=1, random_state=0), random_state=42)), (\u0026#39;classification\u0026#39;, LogisticRegression(random_state = 42)) ]) parameters = {\u0026#39;classification__solver\u0026#39;:(\u0026#39;liblinear\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;lbfgs\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;classification__C\u0026#39;:[1, 5, 10]} # Returns best model in terms of recall score best_grid_model = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid = parameters, cv = 5, refit = True, scoring = \u0026#39;recall\u0026#39;) best_grid_model.fit(X_train, y_train) # A look at how well all hyperparameter combinations perform pd.DataFrame(best_grid_model.cv_results_).sort_values(by = \u0026#39;rank_test_score\u0026#39;) mean_fit_time std_fit_time mean_score_time std_score_time param_classification__C param_classification__solver params split0_test_score split1_test_score split2_test_score split3_test_score split4_test_score mean_test_score std_test_score rank_test_score 2 29.715823 3.306074 0.068921 0.016334 5 liblinear {'classification__C': 5, 'classification__solv... 0.908257 0.935780 0.936364 0.909091 0.889908 0.915880 0.017857 1 3 29.644415 3.598677 0.095378 0.026857 5 lbfgs {'classification__C': 5, 'classification__solv... 0.908257 0.935780 0.936364 0.909091 0.889908 0.915880 0.017857 1 0 29.187842 2.767306 0.057547 0.019141 1 liblinear {'classification__C': 1, 'classification__solv... 0.899083 0.935780 0.927273 0.900000 0.889908 0.910409 0.017804 3 1 28.689645 3.572646 0.104958 0.027626 1 lbfgs {'classification__C': 1, 'classification__solv... 0.899083 0.935780 0.927273 0.900000 0.889908 0.910409 0.017804 3 4 28.605801 2.047266 0.052858 0.005150 10 liblinear {'classification__C': 10, 'classification__sol... 0.908257 0.926606 0.918182 0.890909 0.889908 0.906772 0.014572 5 5 32.235926 3.819624 0.099514 0.020922 10 lbfgs {'classification__C': 10, 'classification__sol... 0.908257 0.926606 0.918182 0.890909 0.889908 0.906772 0.014572 5 A look at the confusion matrix following hyperparameter tuning.\nshow_confusion(y_test, best_grid_model.predict(X_test)) This is a bit better. Our false positive rate has reduced slightly, meaning that this new model is having an easier time differentiating between the two classes than before. In many cases this would suffice, but what if we attempted to let no positive samples slip past our classifier? This is where the fourth step can come in, altering the decision threshold of the model.\nStep 4: Altering the Decision Threshold Altering the decision threshold will allow us to catch more true positive samples by increasing the sensitivity of the model. This increase in sensitivity will come at a cost, however, causing a decrease in the precision of our model. But, that\u0026rsquo;s ok! We are most concerned with catching the true positives in this data and aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly as worried about false positives. Below is a look at our model\u0026rsquo;s precision-recall curve to get a better understanding of the tradeoff between the two measures prior to changing the decision threshold.\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve # Get class probability scores y_scores = best_grid_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] # Returns precision-recall pairs for different probability thresholds p, r, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores) viz_df = pd.DataFrame({\u0026#39;Precision\u0026#39;:p, \u0026#39;Recall\u0026#39;:r}) sns.lineplot(data = viz_df, x = \u0026#34;Recall\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Precision\u0026#34;) For us to achieve perfect recall, the model\u0026rsquo;s precision is going to suffer quite a bit.

Let\u0026rsquo;s flesh that out a bit more. What I mean when I say \u0026ldquo;succinct summary\u0026rdquo; is that I want a quick understanding of a specific aspect for a given product. For example, I know that crocs come in amazing colors already. I can see that in the photos. But, how do they fit? What about their comfort? I find myself often most concerned with a specific aspect of a product such as those. I want to know what people are typically saying about fit and comfort. Many retailers offer a search bar for reviews, so you can filter reviews on a keyword. BUT, searching for \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; across all crocs reviews would return a ton of samples, and how can we know which ones are representative of the general sentiment people have in regards to fit? What if we could give consumers a snapshot of the reviews containing a word or phrase they search for? Could we show them a small set of reviews that best represent all the reviews that mention the word \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo;, for example? I think we can!\nHow to Make it Happen Did someone say centroid-based clustering??? Because they would be correct. For this project we will be using the most popular centroid-based clustering algorithm, k-means.\nAccording to Wikipedia - k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.\nIn other words, k-means searches for the best representation of each cluster (the center) and assigns samples to a cluster based on their distance from each cluster center. So, we can say that a cluster\u0026rsquo;s center is an approximation of all the cluster\u0026rsquo;s members. Following this line of thinking, if we fit a k-means model to some data and only ask it to find 1 cluster, the calculated cluster center will act as a prototype for all the data that was passed to the model. To find the most representative subset of reviews for a particular keyword, we can filter the reviews based on the keyword, find a cluster center for the remaining samples, and get the X closest samples to the center. The closest samples to the center will be the most representative of the population. If this isn\u0026rsquo;t clear, check out the GIF below and imagine we\u0026rsquo;re only trying to make one cluster. Think about how the cluster center / centroid would move in that scenario.\nCredit - Sebastian Charmot, https://towardsdatascience.com/clear-and-visual-explanation-of-the-k-means-algorithm-applied-to-image-compression-b7fdc547e410\nTools Needed Of course we will need Pandas to make for easy data manipulation and usage. We also will need to clean up our text data, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use NLTK. Finally, we need a way to vectorize the text and fit a k-means model to it, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use Scikit-Learn for that part.\nimport pandas as pd from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.cluster import KMeans import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer import re import string Clean Review Data It\u0026rsquo;s usually very important that we stem, remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and remove stopwords from the text we\u0026rsquo;re fitting a model on. We don\u0026rsquo;t want \u0026ldquo;Oranges\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;orange\u0026rdquo; to be treated as different words, nor do we need words like \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo;, for example.\ndef clean_text(text): # Remove punctuation text = re.sub(f\u0026#34;[{re.escape(string.punctuation)}]\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, text) # Convert to lowercase text = text.lower() # Remove stopwords nltk.download(\u0026#39;stopwords\u0026#39;, quiet=True) stop_words = set(stopwords.words(\u0026#39;english\u0026#39;)) tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text) tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words] # Stemming stemmer = PorterStemmer() tokens = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokens] # Join the tokens back into a single string cleaned_text = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join(tokens) return cleaned_text df = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;data\\croc_reviews.csv\u0026#39;) df[\u0026#39;clean_review\u0026#39;] = [clean_text(text_to_clean) for text_to_clean in df[\u0026#39;review\u0026#39;]] df review date rating clean_review 0 !!!!!!

For each of our vectorization methods, we\u0026rsquo;ll also compute an example of their output using the two phrases \u0026ldquo;going to the store to buy bananas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;we buy bananas\u0026rdquo; here. The vectorizers are the following:\nTF-IDF - term frequency-inverse document frequency helps by giving us an understanding of how important a word is within a document relative to an entire corpus. It is calculated by multiplying a word\u0026rsquo;s term frequency (TF) with its inverse document frequency (IDF). TF = # of times word appears in a document / total # of terms in document IDF = log(# of documents in corpus / # of documents in corpus that contain term) TF-IDF = Tf X IDF Sample bananas buy going store the to we \u0026ldquo;going to the store to buy bananas\u0026rdquo; 0.25 0.25 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.71 0.0 \u0026ldquo;we buy bananas\u0026rdquo; 0.50 0.50 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.70 CountVectorizer - Count vectorization converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts.

Never in a kabillion years did I think I'd ever buy a pair of Crocs. Nope, not my style, not my vibe, and not me, ever. But the husband had plantar fasciitis in one of his feet, and the pain was incredible. There are several options for shoes, but we're on a budget, and I kept reading about Crocs as a good starting point. So I ordered him some Crocs in the olive green. Then I thought, \u0026quot;My husband is a big baby. I should order myself a pair, wear them around for a day, and rave about them so he'll immediately start wearing his own pair of Crocs and start healing his feet.\u0026quot; The thing is, I was totally gobsmacked. At first the prickly nubs in the footbed were a bit distracting, but as I started walking around in them, they became less noticeable, and within the first twenty minutes or so, my feet started to feel energized and soothed. I went outside and swept the deck and did some chicken chores, and I was just in heaven. My legs felt supported and I had this incredible feeling of a whole body support system, starting with the acupressure from the footbed nubs and the lightweight shoe material and the fabulous cushioning. These shoes haven't had enough time to mold to my feet, and I'm already blissed out wearing them. I got mine in the olive green, too. They're earthy and surprisingly cute. My husband hasn't worn a clog in his entire life and walked off wearing them for the first time as if little elves were sitting inside his shoes and if he stepped down too hard, they'd get squished and died. A few minutes later, I saw him disappear down the hill at the back of our property. He can't walk when he gets home, his feet are in that much pain. # I was looking for something to wear at night while I was on the AIDS/Lifecycle. It's a 545 mile bicycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles where we raise money for services to HIV+ patients. The ride involves six nights of camping. It's a huge event and the evenings involve a lot of walking. We are allowed 70lbs of gear, but we have to haul our gear to our tent site every night, so traveling light is important. I wanted one pair of shoes for the week that I could put on after riding my bike all day and they would be comfortable enough to wear all week. I wanted one pair of shoes that wasn't going to get icky if the grass was wet at the campsite in the morning. I wanted one pair of shoes that kept my feet warm while I was walking around the campsite in the evening. These shoes totally fit the bill. After beating up my feet all day in cleats on the bike, they were a welcome respite. They allowed air to flow, but my feet never got cold at night. Dirt just wiped off. If I got some gravel in them, it kicked right back out. These shoes were so comfortable I found myself next to the gear trucks digging through my bag to find them and put them on. I know a lot of athletes use Crocs after their activity to kick around in, and these shoes are the shiznit! # These are my first Crocs, and lavender seems to run *almost* a size small. I would say the size 8 Crocs in lavender fits closer to 7 than size 8 street shoes. For reference, I wear size 7 in street shoes (Vans, Converse, Franco Sarto boots, Timberland Kinsley boots), size 38 European shoes (Veja), size 8 running shoes (Mizuno Wave Riders), size 8 Vasque Mesa Trek hiking boots. If you can, try them on. When I measured my feet and checked the Crocs size chart, it said I was a size 10, which would have been way too big. Size 8 lavender fit me roomy but comfortable, whether I'm barefoot or wearing thick, fluffy socks, with or without the Crocs shoe strap. They're super comfy! Those are definitely a bit weird! But, it looks like we\u0026rsquo;ve built something that works. Very cool.\nLooking at More Keywords and Ratings Let\u0026rsquo;s see what people have to say about the comfort and fit of crocs that is positive using both our vectorization methods.\nfind_most_typical(df, \u0026#39;comfort\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;positive\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tfidf\u0026#39;) There are 1847 positive reviews that mention: comfort Most typical reviews are: # The crocs are very comfortable.

However, I wish they had half sizes because I am a 10 1/2 in women and I knew the regular 10 was going to be small, so I got an 11. I didn't like how big it made my feet look.

I purchased a purple pair \u0026amp; decided to size down \u0026amp; get a men's 7 \u0026amp; they were way too small (which also made no sense because I have blue crocs the same size that were a more snug fit). My suggestion is to either make half sizes, or stop with this whole \u0026quot;Roomy Fit\u0026quot; thing that you all are doing. There is zero reason why each pair of crocs should have a different fit. I'll never order crocs online again. I highly recommend just going to the store to make your purchase. The return process is also very strenuous because Crocs does not offer exchanges. So now I have to send them back to the store via UPS, wait for my return to be processed, then wait until I can make my way to a crocs store because the closest store in my area is 36.6 miles away. Ridiculous. # Well, the crocs do not fit my granddaughter. One is actually a different size than the other.

After going through and reading the model outputs, it seems that CountVectorizer works the best for solving this problem. Which makes sense considering we are most concerned with finding the most \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; reviews, and CountVectorizer focuses solely on term frequency to represent documents. Using CountVectorizer seems partial to the selection of shorter reviews, which I would consider an advantage in this space. Quick and succinct is the name of the game here.

Let\u0026rsquo;s flesh that out a bit more. What I mean when I say \u0026ldquo;succinct summary\u0026rdquo; is that I want a quick understanding of a specific aspect for a given product. For example, I know that crocs come in amazing colors already. I can see that in the photos. But, how do they fit? What about their comfort? I find myself often most concerned with a specific aspect of a product such as those. I want to know what people are typically saying about fit and comfort. Many retailers offer a search bar for reviews, so you can filter reviews on a keyword. BUT, searching for \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; across all crocs reviews would return a ton of samples, and how can we know which ones are representative of the general sentiment people have in regards to fit? What if we could give consumers a snapshot of the reviews containing a word or phrase they search for? Could we show them a small set of reviews that best represent all the reviews that mention the word \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo;, for example? I think we can!\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Using Unsupervised ML to 'Typicalize' Product Reviews"},{"content":"\r\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e Motivation Before we get into things, here\u0026rsquo;s a link to download the dataset if you would like.\nDo you ever find yourself pouring over a product\u0026rsquo;s reviews trying to decide if it\u0026rsquo;s right for you? I sure do. Many of these times I\u0026rsquo;ve wished there was a quick summary of the reviews I could read to speed up the decision process. I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to see any online retailers doing exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for, so I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to make my own review summarizer. But, we need some data for training such a tool.\nFor this project I wanted to use data that was fun, interesting, and maybe even a little controversial\u0026hellip; After much thought and deliberation over what product reviews to train a summary generator on, I landed on Crocs. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the clunky rubber footwear my grandmother wears while gardening that some fashionistas would consider an abomination. What\u0026rsquo;s more fun than that??? Maybe or maybe not to your surprise, I searched the internet for a dataset containing reviews for Crocs to no avail. So, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to find our own data. Follow along as I build a webscraper to farm reviews for Crocs Classic Clog, so we can train a review summarizer for the most loved and hated shoes on the planet!\nWhat tools can we use? There are several Python libraries that are helpful for webscraping:\nRequests: To send HTTP requests to websites. Beautiful Soup: For parsing HTML and XML documents. Selenium: For scraping dynamic web pages using browser automation. Pandas: To manipulate and store scraped data. In this project, I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Requests, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas. Selenium isn\u0026rsquo;t needed because we don\u0026rsquo;t need to click anything to move through the review pages on Zappos.com as you\u0026rsquo;ll see later.\nGetting Started Before we start scraping, we need to do some research, meaning that we need to go look around on the internet and assess potential sites for scraping. What sites would have a lot of product reviews for Crocs? The Crocs website itself, Amazon, and Zappos immediately come to mind. After following some initial site evaluation steps outlined here, I decided Zappos.com was the best place to scrape from.\nFirst, we need to figure out how to traverse the pages of reviews on Zappos.com. I went and clicked through the review pages and paid close attention to the URL. I noticed that it explicitly changes with each page. For example, https://www.zappos.com/product/review/7153812/page/1/orderBy/best takes you to the first page, and https://www.zappos.com/product/review/7153812/page/2/orderBy/best takes you to the second page. Easy. To traverse the pages, all we need to do is change a single character in the URL.\nSome Code to Download Whole Webpages I prefer to download whole web pages and extract data from them later. Why? Because companies oftentimes aren\u0026rsquo;t super happy about you scraping their data, and you have to be careful about how your traffic looks as you surf pages. Manners are important! Extracting data from HTML is a messy process that requires development, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to risk having to rerun your scraper because you forgot to write the Beautiful Soup code to extract a product\u0026rsquo;s rating, for example. A script to traverse and download Zappos review pages is below.\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests import random import time HEADERS = ({\u0026#39;User-Agent\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;From\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;chandler_underwood@yahoo.com\u0026#39;}) #Download raw HTML def getdata(url): r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=5) return r.text #Convert HTML to parsable string def html_code(url): htmldata = getdata(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(htmldata, \u0026#39;html.parser\u0026#39;) return (soup) text = \u0026#34;https://www.zappos.com/product/review/7153812/page/{insert}/orderBy/best\u0026#34; #Iterate over all possible URLs for i in range(1, 1000): #Retrieve HTML print(\u0026#34;Scraping: \u0026#34; + text.format(insert = str(i))) code = html_code(text.format(insert = str(i))) #Save file with unique name file = open(\u0026#34;path_to_folder/Zappos_Croc_File_\u0026#34; + str(i) + \u0026#34;.html\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) file.write(str(code)) file.close() #Always remember to be polite time.sleep(random.randint(15,40)) Extracting Data from Webpages Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded the pages of reviews, we need to figure out how to extract the text from the HTML in a useful format. Google Chrome\u0026rsquo;s page inspect tool is great here as it allows us to click on items within the webpage and find their respective HTML tag names. As I clicked on the items I wanted to extract on the webpage, I took note of the tag names associated with them. Beautiful Soup uses these tag names to extract the text we need. Through some trial and error, I ended up with the following function to extract the desired text to make the reviews dataset.\ndef cus_rev_zappos(soup, b = True): review_text = [] date = [] rating = [] rating_type = [] rating_return = [] #Extract review for item in soup.find_all(\u0026#34;div\u0026#34;, class_=\u0026#34;Xl-z Yl-z\u0026#34;): review_text.append(item.get_text()) #Extract review date for item in soup.find_all(\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;): date.append(item.get_text()) #Extract product rating for item in soup.find_all(\u0026#34;span\u0026#34;, class_=\u0026#34;HQ-z\u0026#34;): rating.append(item.get_text()) #Extract product rating type (Overall, Style, Fit, etc.) for item in soup.find_all(\u0026#34;em\u0026#34;, class_=\u0026#34;Ql-z\u0026#34;): rating_type.append(item.get_text()) #We only care about overall product ratings for this project rating = list(zip(rating[5:], rating_type)) for x in rating: if x[1] == \u0026#39;Overall\u0026#39;: rating_return.append(x[0]) return review, date, rating_return I then iterated over and extracted the text from the downloaded web pages using the following code, and we got a decent amount of data! There are over 9,000 distinct reviews here. Below is a glance at the data.\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm reviews, ratings, dates = [], [], [] for x in tqdm(range(len(filenames))): f = open(\u0026#34;path_to_folder/\u0026#34; + filenames[x], \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) soup = BeautifulSoup(f.read(), \u0026#39;html.parser\u0026#39;) review, date, rating = cus_rev_zappos(soup) reviews.extend(review) ratings.extend(rating) dates.extend(date) review_df = pd.DataFrame({\u0026#39;review\u0026#39;: reviews, \u0026#39;date\u0026#39;: date, \u0026#39;rating\u0026#39;: ratings}) review_df.to_csv(\u0026#34;Zappos_Croc_Reviews_Total.csv\u0026#34;) review_df.head(10) review date rating 0 !!!!!!

In the cleanup and feature engineering section, we\u0026rsquo;ll drop those and many others that aren\u0026rsquo;t helpful for understanding my running performances.\nThe first issue with this dataset is that the Avg HR and Max HR columns are populated with some zeros (see table above), and I assure you that my heart was beating faster than that! The Max Temp and Min Temp columns also contain some zeroes. This is because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fancy watch in the beginning of college that logged those metrics. Because of this we can assume that the 0\u0026rsquo;s populating those four columns are actually NULL / missing values. Many of our columns should contain numerical data but instead contain strings such as Min Elevation, so we are going to fix that in the next section too.\nData Cleaning and Feature Engineering First thing we need to do is drop those extraneous columns and correct the data types for our remaining columns.\nimport numpy as np #Drop extraneous columns cols_to_keep = [\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Title\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Time\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg Pace\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Best Pace\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Distance\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Calories\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg HR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max HR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg Run Cadence\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Run Cadence\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Ascent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Descent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg Stride Length\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Elevation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Elevation\u0026#39;] df = df[cols_to_keep] #Replace missing values with NaN for easy pandas manipulation df = df.replace(\u0026#39;--\u0026#39;, np.nan) #String Garmin uses in place of NaN df = df.replace(0.0, np.nan) df = df.replace(0, np.nan) #Remove commas so we can convert these columns to numerical data cols_to_clean = [\u0026#39;Calories\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Ascent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Descent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Elevation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Elevation\u0026#39;] df[cols_to_clean] = df[cols_to_clean].replace({\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;\u0026#39;}, regex=True) #Conversion of columns to floats for use in models def float_convert(col): df[col] = df[col].astype(float) float_convert(cols_to_keep[5:]) There are a few important columns that are written in a time format that is useful for humans but not machines.

Remember, I\u0026rsquo;m doing this, so I can get a better understanding of trends in my running data over the years I ran in college. I want to create some visualizations with this data in the future, and all these values are important in getting a \u0026ldquo;big picture\u0026rdquo; look at my running trends. To deal with the missing data, we have four options:\nDrop the rows that are missing data. Fill NULL rows with some sort of common value (oftentimes the median of the column in question). Bring in an outside data source. Create a predictive model. Option 1 is not going to work here as that would eliminate nearly two thirds of my data. Option 2 works OK for the columns that are missing only a few features, but it would definitely take away from the richness of the data and make for some boring / unhelpful visualizations if we used it for all the missing values in the dataset. But, option 3 can work great for filling in the temperature data as it is easy to find weather data, and option 4 is the way to go for fixing the HR data.\n#Using Option 2 to infill missing data with only a few NULLs cols_with_few_nan = [\u0026#39;Total Ascent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Descent\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Min Elevation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Elevation\u0026#39;] df[cols_with_few_nan] = df[cols_with_few_nan].fillna(df[cols_with_few_nan].median()) Bringing in Some Outside Help Unfortunately, Garmin uses a somewhat cryptic system to log the location of runs. It usually titles each activity as either the county or city name plus \u0026ldquo;Running\u0026rdquo; with no other geolocation data to go along with it. To help us get started, let\u0026rsquo;s look at where my runs occurred that are missing temperature data.\nfrom collections import Counter run_locations = Counter(df[df[\u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;].isna()][\u0026#39;Title\u0026#39;]) sorted(run_locations.items(), key=lambda x:x[1], reverse = True)[:10] [('Oktibbeha County Running', 349), ('Starkville Running', 245), ('Flowood Running', 127), ('Jackson County Running', 120), ('Moss Point Running', 64), ('Mobile County Running', 50), ('Boulder County Running', 43), ('Lucedale Running', 31), ('Oktibbeha County - Running', 21), ('Boulder Running', 21)] Despite differing titles, the vast majority of these samples occur either in my old college town of Starkville, MS or very close to it, and nearly all the rest occur somewhere in Mississippi or in the South. Because we don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to convert these titles to a more specific location without getting really messy, I believe it will suffice to use weather data for Starkville, MS as a proxy for all the missing values we have.\ndf_weather = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;Weather Data.csv\u0026#34;) df_weather = df_weather[[\u0026#39;NAME\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;DATE\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;TMAX\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;TMIN\u0026#39;]].reset_index() df_weather.drop(columns = \u0026#39;index\u0026#39;, inplace = True) df_weather[\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(df_weather[\u0026#39;DATE\u0026#39;]) df_weather[\u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;] = df_weather[\u0026#39;TMIN\u0026#39;] df_weather[\u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;] = df_weather[\u0026#39;TMAX\u0026#39;] #Dataset contains weather reports from several locations surrounding Starkville, so we can group them together. df_weather = df_weather[[\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;]].groupby(by = [\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;]).mean() #Perform inner join, giving us a 1:1 ratio of dates to temperatures df = df.drop(columns = [\u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;]).merge(df_weather, on = \u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;, how = \u0026#39;inner\u0026#39;) #Infill any remaining missing temperature values with the median cols_with_few_nan = [\u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;] df[cols_with_few_nan] = df[cols_with_few_nan].fillna(df[cols_with_few_nan].median()) There you have it, our filled in temperature data. Now, we need to build a model(s) that can effectively populate the missing values in our Max HR and Avg HR columns.\nFitting a model to fill-in our missing data Let\u0026rsquo;s train and evaluate some regression models to fill in all that missing heart rate data. In the end we will have built two models, one to predict the Avg HR columns and another to predict Max HR.\n#Select subset of data with no missing values for training df_train = df.dropna() #Training features X_train = df_train[[\u0026#39;Avg Pace\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Best Pace\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Distance\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Calories\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg Run Cadence\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Run Cadence\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Ascent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Descent\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg Stride Length\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Elevation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Elevation\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Total Run Time\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Min Temp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Max Temp\u0026#39;]] y_avg = df_train[\u0026#39;Avg HR\u0026#39;] y_max = df_train[\u0026#39;Max HR\u0026#39;] Because of my running domain knowledge, I have an idea of what features will be useful for predicting the Max HR and Avg HR columns of our data, but I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of letting scikit-learn decide what features are best for me. Let\u0026rsquo;s select the best 5 features.\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression #The best features to predict Avg HR are not necessarily the best to predict Max HR kb_average = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5).fit(X_train, y_avg) kb_max = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5).fit(X_train, y_max) X_avg = kb_average.transform(X_train) X_max = kb_max.transform(X_train) Now we can use those extracted features to train several regression models and evaluate using cross validation to pick the best one for our two prediction tasks.
