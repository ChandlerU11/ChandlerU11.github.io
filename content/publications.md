# Understanding Teenagers’ Real and Fake News Sharing on Social Media
**Abstract:** In this paper, we present results from our research work focused
on understanding teenagers’ real and fake news sharing on social
media. Using existing real/fake news samples and best practices
in qualitative, inductive data analysis, we identify factors that explain teenagers’ sharing and not sharing behavior of real and fake
news. Our findings suggest that influencing teenagers’ decisions
to share or not share news on social media requires changes in the
knowledge of what is found in social media and enhancement of
knowledge of the algorithmic effects of sharing or not sharing.
